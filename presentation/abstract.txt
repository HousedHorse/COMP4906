Title: Host-Based Anomaly Detection with Extended BPF

Abstract: Extended BPF (eBPF) is an exciting new technology in the Linux kernel
that allows for arbitrary system introspection by loading user-specified bytecode
into the kernel. Further, this introspection comes with production safety guarantees
due to a mandatory verification step before any BPF programs are allowed to run in kernelspace.
eBPF has seen wide use in industry for debugging and performance monitoring applications
and is starting to see some use in computer security, although current research
is primarily focused on network monitoring. In this talk, I will discuss
how eBPF works and what makes it an attractive solution for computer security
applications. I will then present ebpH, a prototype host-based anomaly detection
system that I have built using eBPF. I will use preliminary results from ebpH to make
the case for further research with respect to eBPF in computer security,
both for anomaly detection and other use cases beyond.
