System introspection is becoming an increasingly attractive option
for maintaining operating system stability and security. This is primarily
due to the many recent advances in system introspection technology; in particular,
the 2013 introduction of *eBPF* (*Extended Berkeley Packet Filter*)
into the Linux Kernel [@starovoitov13] along with the recent
development highly usable interfaces such as *bcc* (*BPF Compiler Collection*)
[@bcc] has resulted in highly compelling,
performant, and (perhaps most importantly) safe subsystem for both kernel and userland
instrumentation.

The proposed thesis seeks to test the limits of what eBPF programs are capable of
with respect to the domain of computer security; specifically, I present *ebpH*
(*Extended Berkeley Process Homeostasis*), an eBPF-based intrusion detection
system based on Anil Somayaji's [@soma02] *pH* (*Process Homeostasis*). Preliminary testing
has shown that ebpH is able to detect anomalies in process behavior by instrumenting
system call tracepoints with negligible overhead. Future work will involve testing and
iterating on the ebpH prototype, as well as the implementation of several kernel patches
to further extend its functionality.

# Introduction and Motivation

As our computer systems grow increasingly complex, so too does it
become more and more difficult to gauge precisely what they are doing
at any given moment. Modern computers are often running hundreds, if not thousands
of processes at any given time, the vast majority of which are running silently in
the background. As a result, users often have a very limited notion of what exactly
is happening on their systems, especially beyond that which they can actually see
on their screens. An unfortunate corollary to this observation is that
users *also* have no way of knowing whether their system may be *misbehaving*
at a given moment, whether due to a malicious actor, buggy software, or simply
some unfortunate combination of circumstances.

Recently, a lot of work has been done to help bridge this gap between
system state and visibility, particularly through the introduction of
powerful new tools such as *Extended Berkeley Packet Filter* (eBPF).
Introduced to the Linux Kernel in a 2013 RFC and subsequent kernel patch [@starovoitov13],
eBPF offers a promising interface for kernel introspection, particularly given its
scope and unprecedented level of safety therein; although eBPF can examine
any data structure or function in the kernel through the instrumentation of tracepoints,
its safety is guaranteed via a bytecode verifier. What this means in practice is that we
effectively have unlimited, highly performant, production-safe system
introspection capabilities that can be used to monitor as much or as little
system state as we desire.

Certainly, eBPF offers unprecedented system state visibility, but this is only scratching
the surface of what this technology is capable of. With limitless tracing capabilities,
we can construct powerful applications to enhance system security, stability, and performance.
In theory, these applications can perform much of their work autonomously in the background, but
are equally capable of functioning in a more interactive role, keeping the end user informed
about changes in system state, particularly if these changes in state are undesired. To that end,
I propose *ebpH* (*Extended Berkeley Process Homeostasis*), an intrusion detection system
based entirely on eBPF that monitors process state in the form of system call sequences.
By building and maintaining per-executable behavior profiles, ebpH can dynamically detect when
processes are behaving outside of the status quo, and notify the user so that they can understand
exactly what is going on.

A prototype of ebpH has been written using the Python interface provided by *bcc* (*BPF Compiler Collection*) [@bcc],
and preliminary tests show that it is capable of monitoring system state under moderate to heavy workloads with negligible
overhead. What's more, zero kernel panics occurred during ebpH's development and early testing, which simply
would not have been possible without the safety guarantees that eBPF provides. The rest of this
proposal will cover the necessary background material required to understand ebpH, describe
several aspects of its implementation, including the many findings and pitfalls encountered along the way,
and discuss the planned methodology for testing and iterating on this prototype going forward.

# Background

In the following sections, I will provide the necessary background information needed
to understand ebpH; this includes an overview of system introspection and tracing techniques
on Linux including eBPF itself, and some background on system calls and intrusion detection.

While my work is primarily focused on the use of eBPF for maintaining
system security and stability, the working prototype for ebpH borrows
heavily from Anil Somayaji's *pH* or *Process Homeostais* [@soma02],
an anomaly-based intrusion detection and response system written as a patch for Linux Kernel 2.2.
As such, I will also provide some background on the original pH system and many of the design choices therein.

## Extended Berkeley Packet Filter and System Introspection

System introspection is hardly a novel concept; for years, developers
have been thinking about the best way to solve this problem and have come up
with several unique solutions, each with a variety of benefits and drawbacks.
\autoref{introspection-summary} presents an overview of some prominent examples
relevant to GNU/Linux systems.

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{3.8in}|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Interface and Implementation} & \textbf{Citations}\\
\hline
\hline
strace & Uses the ptrace system call to trace userland processes & \cite{strace, manstrace}  \\
\hline
ltrace & Uses the ptrace system call to trace library calls in userland processes & \cite{rubirabranco07, manltrace}  \\
\hline
SystemTap & Dynamically generates loadable kernel modules for instrumentation; newer versions can optionally use eBPF as a backend instead &  \cite{systemtap, merey17}\\
\hline
ftrace & Sysfs pseudo filesystem for tracepoint instrumentation located at \texttt{/sys/kernel/debug/tracing} & \cite{ftrace}\\
\hline
perf\_events & Linux subsystem that collects performance events and returns them to userspace & \cite{manperfeventopen}  \\
\hline
LTTng & Loadable kernel modules, userland libraries & \cite{lttng}\\
\hline
dtrace4linux & A Linux port of DTrace via a loadable kernel module & \cite{dtrace4linux} \\
\hline
sysdig & Loadable kernel modules for system monitoring; native support for containers & \cite{sysdig} \\
\hline
eBPF & In-kernel virtual machine for running pre-verified bytecode & \cite{bcc, goldstein16, starovoitov13} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

These technologies can, in general, be classified into a few broad categories (\autoref{instr-cmp}),
albeit with potential overlap depending on the tool:

(1) Userland libraries.
(1) Ptrace-based instrumentation.
(1) Loadable kernel modules.
(1) Kernel subsystems.

Applications such as strace [@strace; @manstrace] which make use of the ptrace system call are certainly
a viable option for limited system introspection with respect to specific processes.
However, this does not represent a complete solution, as we are limited to monitoring
the system calls made by a process to communicate with the kernel, its memory, and the state of its registers,
rather than the underlying kernel functions themselves [@manptrace]. The scope of ptrace-based solutions is
also limited by ptrace's lack of scalability; ptrace's API is conducive to tracing single processes at a time rather
than tracing processes system wide. Its limited scale becomes even more obvious when considering the high
amount of context-switching between kernel space and user space required when tracing multiple processes or threads,
especially when these processes and threads make many hundreds of system calls per second [@keniston07].

Although library call instrumentation through software such as ltrace [@rubirabranco07; @manltrace]
does not necessarily suffer from the
same performance issues as described above, it still constitutes a suboptimal solution for many
use cases due to its limited scope. In order to be effective and provide a complete picture of what
exactly is going on during a given process' execution, library tracing needs to be combined with other solutions.
In fact, ltrace does exactly this; when the user specifies the `-S` flag, ltrace uses the ptrace systemcall
to perform strace-like functionality.

LKM-based implementations such as sysdig [@sysdig] and SystemTap [@systemtap] offer an extremely
deep and powerful tracing solution given their ability to instrument the entire system, including
the kernel itself. Their primary detriment is a lack of safety guarantees with respect to the modules
themselves. No matter how vetted or credible a piece of software might be, running it natively in
the kernel always comports with an inherent level of risk; buggy code might cause system failure,
loss of data, or other unintended and potentially catastrophic consequences.

Custom tracing solutions through kernel modules carry essentially the same risks.
No sane manager would consent to running untrusted, unvetted code natively in the kernel
of a production system; the risks are simply too great and far outweigh the benefits.
Instead, such code must be carefully examined, reviewed, and tested, a process which
can potentially take months. What's more, even allowing for a careful testing and vetting
process, there is always some probability that a bug can slip through the cracks, resulting
in the catastrophic consequences outlined above.

Built-in kernel subsystems for instrumentation seem to be the most desirable choice of any
of the presented solutions. In fact, eBPF [@starovoitov13] itself constitutes one such solution. However,
for the time being, we will focus on a few others, namely ftrace [@ftrace] and perf\_events [@manperfeventopen]
(eBPF programs actually *can* and *do* use both of these interfaces anyway). While both of these solutions are
safe to use (assuming we trust the user), they suffer from limited documentation and relatively poor user interfaces.
These factors in tandem mean that ftrace and perf\_events, while quite useful for a variety of system introspection
needs, are less extensible than other approaches.

### eBPF: Linux Tracing Superpowers

In 2016, eBPF was described by Brendan Gregg [@gregg16],
a prominent member of the Iovisor project, as nothing short of *Linux tracing superpowers*.
I echo that sentiment here, as it summarizes eBPF's capabilities perfectly.
